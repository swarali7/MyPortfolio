    <h2>Hey, I'm Swarali!</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">I'm a Software Engineer and graduate student at Virginia Tech. I specialize in full-stack web development, software engineering and security. Over the years, I've built a solid foundation in programming and software development, and I've had the opportunity to apply this knowledge in real-world settings.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">At Bank of America, I worked on web development and process automation projects, where I helped optimize internal workflows and collaboration with different upstreams and downstream teams. One of my key contributions was to streamline the approval process for internal projects, reducing bottlenecks and improving team productivity. I also developed tools that automated data processing tasks, significantly cutting down on manual effort and improving the accuracy of reporting.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Cummins College of Engineering, where I developed skills in both programming and systems design. During my time at Cummins, I also contributed to several projects, including a mobile app for Image Steganography and a web-based platform for Video Conferencing implementing real-time communication.</p>

    <h3>My Approach to Development</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">When I develop software, I focus on creating clean, scalable, and maintainable solutions. I prioritize user experience and usability, making sure that the end product is both functional and intuitive. I’ve gained experience working in Agile teams, and I’m comfortable with all stages of the development process—from ideation and planning to deployment and maintenance. I value collaboration and enjoy working with other developers to tackle challenges and create high-quality software.</p>
